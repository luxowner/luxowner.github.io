## Usage Examples & API Documentation (if applicable)

This project is a static site; there is no API. To customize the content, edit the Markdown files in the root directory and the HTML files in the `_includes` and `_layouts` directories.

*   **Adding a new page:** Create a new `.md` file in the root directory with YAML front matter:

    ```md
    ---
    layout: page
    title: About Me
    ---

    This is the content of the about me page.
    ```

*   **Editing the navigation:** Modify the `_includes/menu.html` file to adjust the navigation links.

## Configuration Options

The main configuration file is `_config.yml`.  Here are some key configurable settings:

*   **`title`:**  The title of your website.
*   **`description`:**  A short description of your website.
*   **`baseurl`:**  The subpath of your site if it is hosted in a subdirectory (e.g., `/blog`).  Leave blank if hosting at the root domain.
